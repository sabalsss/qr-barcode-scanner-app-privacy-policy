  <h1>Privacy Policy — QR Code Scanner: QR & Barcode</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the QR Code Scanner: QR & Barcode app ("the App") handles your information. We designed the App to scan QR codes and barcodes on your device with privacy in mind.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account and no personal data collection</strong>: We do not collect, sell, rent, or share personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>On-device processing</strong>: Camera frames used for scanning stay on your device and are not uploaded.</li>
    <li><strong>No ads and no analytics SDKs</strong>: The App does not include advertising, analytics, or crash-reporting SDKs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera input (on-device only)</strong>: The camera is used solely to detect and decode QR codes and barcodes in real time. Frames are processed locally and are not stored or transmitted by the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Scan results you choose to act on</strong>: If you tap a result (for example, to open a URL, join Wi‑Fi, share text, or copy content), that action may involve other apps or system services which are governed by their own policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions We Use and Why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>: Enables scanning QR codes and barcodes with the device camera.</li>
    <li><code>android.permission.VIBRATE</code>: Provides optional haptic feedback after a successful scan.</li>
    <li><code>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> and <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>: Allows the App to open links you choose and to check connectivity when needed for those user‑initiated actions. The App does not upload personal data.</li>
    <li><code>android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE</code> and <code>android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE</code>: Lets the App read Wi‑Fi status and, when you explicitly choose a Wi‑Fi QR code result, help you connect by adjusting Wi‑Fi settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties. There are no embedded third‑party SDKs (e.g., advertising, analytics, crash reporting) in the App.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>The App does not retain personal data. Camera frames are processed in memory and discarded. Scan history, if shown, exists only on your device unless you choose to clear it. If you export or share results, those actions are controlled by you.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to process data locally and minimize network use. As with any software, no method is 100% secure, but the App is built to avoid transmitting camera data off the device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Updates will be posted in this file and/or on the App’s store listing with a new effective date.</p>
